Wireless Sensor Scheduller using Machine Learning Method
For each sensor has it owns deadlines , computing time , period and start time 
several works are done using Deadline Monotonic Scheduling or Rate Monotonic Schedulling but the result is not optimize.

This repo are trying to use Machine Learning Approach to optimize Superframe Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks sor the Tardines will be minimized
