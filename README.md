Wireless Sensor Scheduller using Machine Learning Method
For each sensor has it owns deadlines , computing time , period and start time 
several works are done using Deadline Monotonic Scheduling or Rate Monotonic Schedulling but the result is not optimize, such as a lot of miss deadlines and tardy jobs.

This repo are trying to use Machine Learning Approach to optimize Superframe Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks so the Tardines will be minimized and miss deadline will be reduced.

There are several method will be tested : 
- Deadline Monotonic Approach 
- Rate Monotonic Approach 
- Genetic Algorithm Approach 
- Combine the Genetic Algorithm Approach with Deadline Monotonic Schedulling
